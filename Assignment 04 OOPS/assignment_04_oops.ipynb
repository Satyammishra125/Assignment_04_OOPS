    "## Question 1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "Ans. The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: This means keeping data and functions that work on that data together in one place (like putting your belongings in a box). It helps protect the data from being changed unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**: This is about showing only the important details and hiding the complex parts. It’s like using a remote control—you only see buttons, not the complicated technology inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**: This allows one class (or type of object) to use features from another class. Think of it like a family where children inherit traits from their parents, allowing them to share common characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**: This means that the same function can work in different ways based on the object it’s used with. It’s like a person who can speak different languages; they adapt based on who they’re talking to.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Composition**: This involves building complex objects using simpler ones. It’s like assembling a car from different parts, where each part has its own function, but together they create something more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts help make code easier to understand, use, and maintain."

    "## Question 13. Explain the concept of the Diamond Problem in multiple inheritance. How does Python resolve it?\n",
    "Ans. The Diamond Problem occurs in multiple inheritance scenarios when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common ancestor. This creates a diamond shape in the inheritance hierarchy. The challenge arises when trying to determine which version of a method or attribute should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diamond Problem Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following class structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "      A\n",
    "     / \\\n",
    "    B   C\n",
    "     \\ /\n",
    "      D\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class `A` is the base class.\n",
    "- Classes `B` and `C` both inherit from `A`.\n",
    "- Class `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If class `D` tries to call a method that exists in class `A`, it creates ambiguity: should `D` use the method from `B` or from `C`?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python's Resolution: Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python resolves the Diamond Problem using a method called **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**. The MRO defines the order in which base classes are searched when executing a method. Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine this order, which ensures that:\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **A class is only considered after all its parents have been checked**.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Output\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above:\n",
    "- `D` inherits from `B` and `C`, both of which inherit from `A`.\n",
    "- When `d.greet()` is called, Python looks for the `greet` method in `D`, then in `B`, then in `C`, and finally in `A`.\n",
    "- The MRO for class `D` would be `[D, B, C, A]`, meaning `D` will first check `B` for the `greet` method, which is why the output is \"Hello from B\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking the MRO\n",
    "\n",
    "we can view the MRO of a class using the `mro()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(D.mro())  # Output: [<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]\n",
    "```\n",

    "1. **Class Variable**: `instance_count` is a class variable that is shared among all instances of the class. It keeps track of the number of instances created.\n",

    "2. **Constructor**: In the `__init__` method, each time a new instance is created, we increment `instance_count` by 1.\n",
    "\n",
